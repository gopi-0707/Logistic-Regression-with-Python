# Project Title: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview:
This project aims to predict the survival outcome (survived or deceased) of passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression for classification. We will implement logistic regression in Python to analyze the provided dataset.

## Dataset:
We will be using a "semi-cleaned" version of the Titanic dataset, which includes various features such as age, gender, ticket class, and fare. The dataset has been preprocessed to some extent to facilitate analysis.

## Implementation:
The main focus of the project will be on implementing logistic regression for classification. We will utilize Python and its libraries for data analysis, visualization, and model building.

## Files:
- **titanic_train.csv**: The dataset containing passenger information.
- **EDA_Modelling.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of logistic regression for survival prediction.

## Instructions:
1. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file to view the implementation details.
4. Execute the cells in the notebook to run the code and analyze the results.
